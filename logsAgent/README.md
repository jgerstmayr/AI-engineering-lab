# Agent results
Note that this folder contains both the results obtained by running `python agentDriver.py -m logsAgent -l -twoFails` (allTests.zip) and using OpenAI's API for inference with GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06).

Before running the agent for allTests.zip, results_MC.json and results_GE.json from the folder log_QwenCoder-32B-Q4 was copied to each specific LLM log folder (e.g., log_Phi4-Q4). This needs to be done for each agent run where the model creation should be skipped (validation only).
