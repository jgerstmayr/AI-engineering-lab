# improvements:
#   - elastic chain: boundaries are mass points on spherical joints
#   - rolling disc: prescribe angular velocity as -v/r
#   - artifact: several "L" as lengths are removed, as they are never replaced by Phi4
#   - remove errors such as missing gravity
#   - avoid spherical joints
#   - avoid specification of COM
#   - point mass: strongly recommend [0,0,0] as localPosition in helper files
#   - double pendulum: avoid saying arm2 relative to arm1

########################################################
# potential future features:
# list of models that has nDOF represented. These are used for that kind of "validation"
# --> 3 levels of validation
# 1) executable code
# 2) nDOF (mind, only possible for some models) - Contact models not suitable for that kind of "validation"; use this for "constrained" joint systems
# 3) closing conjecturesLoop
