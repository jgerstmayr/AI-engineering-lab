LLM task: choose Exudyn elements

=======================================
LLM input prompt:

The following elements are available in the simulation code Exudyn:
general information: Use the following information as an update of the internal data of the Python multibody code Exudyn.
ground: Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
point mass: Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
spring damper: Create a linear spring-damper system between two bodies or between a body and the ground.
distance constraint: Create a rigid distance constraint between two points on different bodies or between a body and the ground.
force for point mass: Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
Projectile motion of a point mass with the following properties: mass m = 10 kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2, initial velocity in x/y/z-direction: vx = 5 m/s, vy = 10 m/s, vz = 0 m/s. The initial position is given as x=0 and y=0. Gravity acts along the negative y-axis, and there is no other external propulsion or resistance. The motion shall be evaluated for 1 s. Contact with ground is not modelled, so the projectile can go below y=0. Except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass.

Please list the elements that are required to build the given multibody model and which represent its mechanical behavior best, without repeating any element.
Provide elements in a plain list such as element1, element2, ... , using exactly the provided terms, and don't add other text or explanations.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Projectile motion of a point mass with the following properties: mass m = 10 kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2, initial velocity in x/y/z-direction: vx = 5 m/s, vy = 10 m/s, vz = 0 m/s. The initial position is given as x=0 and y=0. Gravity acts along the negative y-axis, and there is no other external propulsion or resistance. The motion shall be evaluated for 1 s. Contact with ground is not modelled, so the projectile can go below y=0. Except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Projectile motion of a point mass with the following properties: mass m = 10  kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2, initial velocity in x/y/z-direction: vx = 5 m/s, vy = 10 m/s, vz = 0 m/s. The initial position is given as x=0 and y=0. Gravity acts along the negative y-axis, and there is no other external propulsion or resistance. The motion shall be evaluated for 1 s. Contact with ground is not modelled, so the projectile can go below y=0. Except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

LLM input prompt:

The following elements are available in the simulation code Exudyn:
general information: Use the following information as an update of the internal data of the Python multibody code Exudyn.
ground: Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
point mass: Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
Free-fall motion of an object with the following properties: point mass m = 1.5  kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 (in negative z-direction). The object starts from rest and is dropped from a height hz = 20 m. The free fall shall be analyzed for 1 s. Air resistance is neglected and except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass..
