The following Python example shows how to generate a multibody model in Exudyn, including most relevant features: 

#import Exudyn library and utilities
import exudyn as exu
from exudyn.utilities import *
import numpy as np

#set up new multibody system to work with
SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.
oGround = mbs.CreateGround(referencePosition=[0,0,0])

#Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
#physicsMass: the mass in kg
#referencePosition: initial/reference position at which mechanism is defined; 
#initialDisplacement: additional initial deviations from referencePosition; usually this is [0,0,0]
#initialVelocity: initial velocities of mass point
#all vectors always have 3 components, no matter if 2D or 3D problem
oMass = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=5, referencePosition=[1,0,0], 
                            initialDisplacement=[0,0,0],  #optional, relative to reference position
                            initialVelocity=[0,0.5,0],    #optional
                            gravity=[0,-9.81,0])          #optional

#Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
#apply 10N in x-direction on point mass with index oMass
loadMassPoint = mbs.CreateForce(bodyNumber=oMass, loadVector=[10,0,0])

#Assemble has to be called just before solving or system analysis (after AddSensor!).
mbs.Assemble()

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Projectile motion of a point mass with the following properties: mass m = 12.5 kg, gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2, initial velocity in x/y/z-direction: vx = 0.125 m/s, vy = 12.5 m/s, vz = 0 m/s. The initial position is given as x=0 and y=0. Gravity acts along the negative y-axis, and there is no other external propulsion or resistance. The motion shall be evaluated for 1 s. Contact with ground is not modelled, so the projectile can go below y=0. Except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Projectile motion of a point mass with the following properties: mass m = 7.5 kg, gravity g = 11.15 m/s^2, initial velocity in x/y/z-direction: vx = 0.075 m/s, vy = 12.5 m/s, vz = 0 m/s. The initial position is given as x=0 and y=0. Gravity acts along the negative y-axis, and there is no other external propulsion or resistance. The motion shall be evaluated for 1 s. Contact with ground is not modelled, so the projectile can go below y=0. Except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The object starts from rest and is dropped from a height hz = 25 m. The free fall shall be analyzed for 1 s. Air resistance is neglected and except the action of gravity, no forces act on the point mass..

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Simple slider-crank mechanism modelled with two mass points that are connected with distance constraints. The crank is modelled with a point mass m1 = 4 kg, located at radius r = 1.25 m (initially located at x=0, y=r) and constrained to ground with a distance r; the slider is a point mass m2 = 4 kg, initially located at xSlider = 3 m and ySlider = 0. The connecting rod is only represented as distance constraint between crank mass and slider mass. Add a spherical joint between mass 1 and ground and only constrain the z-axis motion and a second spherical joint to constrain the y- and z-axes motion of mass 2. A force fx = 15 acts on the slider in positive x-direction. The system is initially at rest, and no gravity is applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

A force fx = 15 acts on the slider in positive x-direction. The system is initially at rest, and no gravity is applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The crank is modelled with a point mass m1 = 0.8 kg, located at radius r = 1.2 m (initially located at x=0, y=r) and constrained to ground with a distance r; the slider is a point mass m2 = 0.6 kg, initially located at xSlider = 2 m and ySlider = 0. The connecting rod is only represented as distance constraint between crank mass and slider mass. Add a spherical joint between mass 1 and ground and only constrain the z-axis motion and a second spherical joint to constrain the y- and z-axes motion of mass 2.

The following Python example shows how to generate a multibody model in Exudyn, including most relevant features: 

#import Exudyn library and utilities
import exudyn as exu
from exudyn.utilities import *
import numpy as np

#set up new multibody system to work with
SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.
oGround = mbs.CreateGround(referencePosition=[0,0,0])

#Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
#physicsMass: the mass in kg
#referencePosition: initial/reference position at which mechanism is defined; 
#initialDisplacement: additional initial deviations from referencePosition; usually this is [0,0,0]
#initialVelocity: initial velocities of mass point
#all vectors always have 3 components, no matter if 2D or 3D problem
oMass = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=5, referencePosition=[1,0,0], 
                            initialDisplacement=[0,0,0],  #optional, relative to reference position
                            initialVelocity=[0,0.5,0],    #optional
                            gravity=[0,-9.81,0])          #optional

#Create a rigid distance constraint between two points on different bodies or between a body and the ground.
#NOTE: localPosition0 resp. localPosition1 are the positions relativ to body0 resp. 1 (or ground); localPosition is always [0,0,0] for point masses; on ground, localPosition depends on position where the distance constraint should be anchored; use distance=None as it is computed automatically (safer)
oDistance = mbs.CreateDistanceConstraint(bodyNumbers=[oGround, oMass], #[body0,body1]
                                         localPosition0 = [0,0,0], #locally on body0
                                         localPosition1 = [0,0,0], #locally on body1
                                         distance=None)

#Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
#apply 10N in x-direction on point mass with index oMass
loadMassPoint = mbs.CreateForce(bodyNumber=oMass, loadVector=[10,0,0])

#Create a spherical joint between two bodies/ground
oMassPoint = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=2, referencePosition=[1,0,0])

#create spherical joint between ground and mass point; could also be applied to two bodies; possible bodies: mass point or rigid body
mbs.CreateSphericalJoint(bodyNumbers=[oGround, oMassPoint],
                         position=[1,0,0], #global position of joint (in reference configuration)
                         constrainedAxes=[1,1,1]) #x,y,z directions: 1 = fixed, 0 = free motion

#Assemble has to be called just before solving or system analysis (after AddSensor!).
mbs.Assemble()

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Simple slider-crank mechanism modelled with two mass points that are connected with distance constraints. The crank is modelled with a point mass m1 = 0.8 kg, located at radius r = 1.2 m (initially located at x=0, y=r) and constrained to ground with a distance r; the slider is a point mass m2 = 0.6 kg, initially located at xSlider = 2 m and ySlider = 0. The connecting rod is only represented as distance constraint between crank mass and slider mass. Add a spherical joint between mass 1 and ground and only constrain the z-axis motion and a second spherical joint to constrain the y- and z-axes motion of mass 2. A force fx = 8 acts on the slider in positive x-direction. The system is initially at rest, and no gravity is applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Simple mathematical pendulum with the following properties: point mass m = 1.2 kg, elastic string length = 1 m, string stiffness k = 2000 N/m, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 which is applied in negative y-direction. The pendulum's reference configuration is such that the string has an angle 50 degrees from the vertical (negative y-axis), thus the mass being on a positive x-coordinate for positive angles. The initial velocities of the mass point are v_x = 0.015 m/s and v_y = -0.075 m/s, applied in x resp. y direction.

Please list the elements that are required to build the given multibody model and which represent its mechanical behavior best, without repeating any element.

The following Python example shows how to generate a multibody model in Exudyn, including most relevant features: 

#import Exudyn library and utilities

#set up new multibody system to work with
SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.
oGround = mbs.CreateGround(referencePosition=[0,0,0])

#Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
#physicsMass: the mass in kg
#referencePosition: initial/reference position at which mechanism is defined; 
#initialDisplacement: additional initial deviations from referencePosition; usually this is [0,0,0]
#initialVelocity: initial velocities of mass point
#all vectors always have 3 components, no matter if 2D or 3D problem
oMass = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=5, referencePosition=[1,0,0],

#Create a linear spring-damper system between two bodies or between a body and the ground.
#NOTE: localPosition0 resp. localPosition1 are the positions relativ to body0 resp. 1 (or ground); localPosition is always [0,0,0] for point masses; on ground, localPosition depends on position where the spring-damper should be anchored
oSpringDamper = mbs.CreateSpringDamper(bodyNumbers=[oGround, oMass], #[body0,body1]
                                      localPosition0=[0,0,0], #locally on body0
                                      localPosition1=[0,0,0], #locally on body1
                                      referenceLength=None, #usually set to None (default) => takes the (relaxed) length in reference configuration
                                      stiffness=1e2, damping=1)

#Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.

loadMassPoint = mbs.CreateForce(bodyNumber=oMass, loadVector=[10,0,0])

#Assemble has to be called just before solving or system analysis (after AddSensor!).
mbs.Assemble()

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Two-mass-spring-damper system consisting of two masses with the following properties: mass m1 = m2 = 12 kg, stiffness k1 = k2 = 7500 N/m, and damping d1 = d2 = 12.5 Ns/m. The first mass is placed at [7.5 cm,0,0] and the second mass at [2*7.5 cm,0,0]. The first spring is connected to ground at [0,0,0], and the second spring connects the two masses. Each spring has a reference length of 7.5 cm and is relaxed in the initial configuration. A force 5 is applied in x-direction to mass 2. No gravity is applied to the system.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Two-mass-spring-damper system consisting of two masses with the following properties: mass m1 = m2 = 10 kg, stiffness k1 = k2 = 1250 N/m, and damping d1 = d2 = 10 Ns/m. The first mass is placed at [12.5 cm,0,0] and the second mass at [2*12.5 cm,0,0]. The first spring is connected to ground at [0,0,0], and the second spring connects the two masses. Each spring has a reference length of 12.5 cm and is relaxed in the initial configuration. A force 10 is applied in x-direction to mass 2. No gravity is applied to the system.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The following elements are available in the simulation code Exudyn:
general information: Use the following information as an update of the internal data of the Python multibody code Exudyn.
ground: Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
point mass: Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
spring damper: Create a linear spring-damper system between two bodies or between a body and the ground.
distance constraint: Create a rigid distance constraint between two points on different bodies or between a body and the ground.
rigid body omniform: Create a rigid body with an abitrary shape.
rigid body sphere: Create a rigid body with a spherical shape.
rigid body cylinder: Create a rigid body with a cylindrical shape.
rigid body brick-shape: Create a rigid body with a brick (cuboid) shape; uses rotated reference configuration.
force for point mass: Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
force for rigid body: Applies a force in a specific direction to a rigid body at its local position.
force with time-dependent user function: Defines a time-dependent force function and applies it to a rigid body or mass point at a specific local position.
torque with user function: Defines a user function of a time-dependent 3D torque function and applies it to a rigid body
torque: Applies a 3D torque to a rigid body.
spherical joint: Create a spherical joint between two bodies/ground
prismatic joint: Create a prismatic joint between two rigid bodies / ground, allowing linear motion along a specified axis; position and axis are defined in global reference configuration
revolute joint: Create a revolute joint between two rigid bodies / ground, allowing rotation about a specified axis; not compatible with point mass.
torsional spring-damper: Create a torsional spring-damper between two bodies, ideally in combination with a revolute joint.
rolling disc with penalty-based joint: Create a rigid body of a cylindrical disc (or wheel), and a rolling disc joint between the disc and the ground (ground must be first body); ground is defined by planePosition and planeNormal and disc joint is defined in body-local coordinates with axisPosition and axisVector; uses penalty formulation with linear contact and damping model.
ideal rolling disc joint: Create a rigid body of a cylindrical disc (or wheel), and a joint between the rolling disc and the ground (ground must be first body); ground is defined by planePosition and planeNormal and disc joint is defined in body-local coordinates with axisPosition and axisVector
cartesian spring damper: Create a special spring-damper which acts on translations in global x, y, and z-direction, with possibility to connect rigid bodies, mass points together or on ground.

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
A serial chain of 5 masses connected with springs-dampers. Each mass has m = 12.5 kg, the stiffnesses are k = 3000 N/m, and the damping coefficients are d = 60 Ns/m. A force f = 100 N is applied to the last mass (with highest index). The first mass is connected to ground via the first spring-damper. The relaxed length of each spring is 0.5 m, and the first mass is located at z = 0.5 m. The serial chain is oriented along the global z-axis. Gravity acts in positive z-direction, with g = 9.81 m/s^2.

Please list the elements that are required to build the given multibody model and which represent its mechanical behavior best, without repeating any element.
Provide elements in a plain list such as element1, element2, ... , using exactly the provided terms, and don't add other text or explanations.

The following Python example shows how to generate a multibody model in Exudyn, including most relevant features: 

#import Exudyn library and utilities
import exudyn as exu
from exudyn.utilities import *
import numpy as np

#set up new multibody system to work with
SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.
oGround = mbs.CreateGround(referencePosition=[0,0,0])

#Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
#physicsMass: the mass in kg
#referencePosition: initial/reference position at which mechanism is defined; 
#initialDisplacement: additional initial deviations from referencePosition; usually this is [0,0,0]
#initialVelocity: initial velocities of mass point
#all vectors always have 3 components, no matter if 2D or 3D problem
oMass = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=5, referencePosition=[1,0,0], 
                            initialDisplacement=[0,0,0],  #optional, relative to reference position
                            initialVelocity=[0,0.5,0],    #optional
                            gravity=[0,-9.81,0])          #optional

#Create a linear spring-damper system between two bodies or between a body and the ground.
#NOTE: localPosition0 resp. localPosition1 are the positions relativ to body0 resp. 1 (or ground); localPosition is always [0,0,0] for point masses; on ground, localPosition depends on position where the spring-damper should be anchored
oSpringDamper = mbs.CreateSpringDamper(bodyNumbers=[oGround, oMass], #[body0,body1]
                                      localPosition0=[0,0,0], #locally on body0
                                      localPosition1=[0,0,0], #locally on body1
                                      referenceLength=None, #usually set to None (default) => takes the (relaxed) length in reference configuration
                                      stiffness=1e2, damping=1)

#Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
#apply 10N in x-direction on point mass with index oMass
loadMassPoint = mbs.CreateForce(bodyNumber=oMass, loadVector=[10,0,0])

#Assemble has to be called just before solving or system analysis (after AddSensor!).
mbs.Assemble()

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A serial chain of 5 masses connected with springs-dampers. Each mass has m = 12.5 kg, the stiffnesses are k = 3000 N/m, and the damping coefficients are d = 60 Ns/m. A force f = 100 N is applied to the last mass (with highest index). The first mass is connected to ground via the first spring-damper. The relaxed length of each spring is 0.5 m, and the first mass is located at z = 0.5 m. The serial chain is oriented along the global z-axis. Gravity acts in positive z-direction, with g = 9.81 m/s^2.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Air resistance is neglected.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Double pendulum system consisting of two mass points which are connected with inextensible strings with the following properties: mass m1 = 2 kg, mass m2 = 1 kg, length of the strings L1 = 0.5 m, L2 = 0.75 m, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The first arm of the pendulum points in positive x direction and the second arm in positive y-direction. The strings are massless, inelastic and the length shall be constrained. Air resistance is neglected.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Multibody n-pendulum system consisting of 5 point masses with the following properties: masses m = 1.5 kg, length of inextensible strings l_single = 1.5 m, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2. The pendulum starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned along the x-axis (the first mass starting at x=1.5) and all masses have an initial velocity of 0.8 m/s in negative y-direction. Gravity acts in negative y-direction and air resistance is neglected. The strings between the consecutive masses (and the string between first mass and ground) shall be modelled as constrained distances.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Multibody n-pendulum system consisting of 3 point masses with the following properties: masses m = 0.8 kg, length of inextensible strings l_single = 2 m, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2. The pendulum starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned along the x-axis (the first mass starting at x=2) and all masses have an initial velocity of 0.03 m/s in negative y-direction. Gravity acts in negative y-direction and air resistance is neglected. The strings between the consecutive masses (and the string between first mass and ground) shall be modelled as constrained distances.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A planar four-bar mechanism modelled with 2 points masses and the 3 moving bars modeled as massless distance constraints. The origin point of the mechanism on ground is located at [0,0,0], mass 1 with m1 = 3 kg is located at [0,0.12,0], mass 2 with m2 = 1 kg is located at [1,0.12,0] and the final additional ground point is at [1,-0.25,0]. Gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction and mass 1 has an initial velocity of [0.3,0,0]. There is no friction or other resistance.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction and mass 1 has an initial velocity of [0.2,0,0]. There is no friction or other resistance.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Two free flying rigid elements, each modeled as a rigid body with brick-shape (density = 1200 kg/m^3, lx=1 m, wy=0.125 m, hz=0.05 m). Rigid body 1 is globally placed at [lx/2,0,0] and rigid body 2 at [3*lx/2,0,0], both bodies' COMs being at their origin. A Cartesian spring-damper with stiffness [15000,15000,15000] N/m and damping [125,125,125] Ns/m is attached between rigid body 1 at [lx/2,0,0] (local position) and rigid body 2 at [-lx/2,0,0] (also local position). Body1 has initial velocity [0,1,0] and body2 has initial velocity [0,-1,0] and gravity is zero.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The disc is mounted on a frictionless revolute joint and experiences a constant torque T_z = 0.8. No gravity acts on the disc.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
An inverted pendulum on a cart modelled with two mass points, where the cart is attached to ground with a spherical joint where the x-coordinate is not constrained, such that it can move along the x-direction. The pendulum is modelled with a distance constraint between cart and pendulum mass: cart mass m1 = 4 kg, pendulum mass m2 = 0.5 kg, pendulum length = 1 m, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The pendulum starts from the upright position, where m2 is located at the positive y-axis. A disturbance force f = 0.01 N acts in x-direction at the pendulum and no control is applied on the cart.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

#NOTE: localPosition0 resp. localPosition1 are the positions relativ to body0 resp. 1 (or ground); localPosition is always [0,0,0] for point masses; on ground, localPosition depends on position where the distance constraint should be anchored; use distance=None as it is computed automatically (safer)

Rolling shall be modelled ideal and without slipping.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Rolling motion of a solid disc rolling on a x/y plane with the following properties: mass m = 3 kg, radius r = 0.5 m, width w = 0.03 m, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 (in negative z-direction). The disc's axis is initially aligned with the x-axis. The COM of the disc has an initial position of p0 = [-0.01,0.015,0.5], translational velocity of v_y = 0.6 m/s and an initial angular velocity omega_x=-v_y/radius. Rolling shall be modelled ideal and without slipping.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

#set up new multibody system to work with
SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.

#Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
#physicsMass: the mass in kg
#referencePosition: initial/reference position at which mechanism is defined; 
#initialDisplacement: additional initial deviations from referencePosition; usually this is [0,0,0]
#initialVelocity: initial velocities of mass point
#all vectors always have 3 components, no matter if 2D or 3D problem
oMass = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=5, referencePosition=[1,0,0], 
                            initialDisplacement=[0,0,0],  #optional, relative to reference position
                            initialVelocity=[0,0.5,0],    #optional
                            gravity=[0,-9.81,0])          #optional

#Create a linear spring-damper system between two bodies or between a body and the ground.
#NOTE: localPosition0 resp. localPosition1 are the positions relativ to body0 resp. 1 (or ground); localPosition is always [0,0,0] for point masses; on ground, localPosition depends on position where the spring-damper should be anchored
oSpringDamper = mbs.CreateSpringDamper(bodyNumbers=[oGround, oMass], #[body0,body1]
                                      localPosition0=[0,0,0], #locally on body0
                                      localPosition1=[0,0,0], #locally on body1
                                      referenceLength=None, #usually set to None (default) => takes the (relaxed) length in reference configuration
                                      stiffness=1e2, damping=1)

#Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
#apply 10N in x-direction on point mass with index oMass
loadMassPoint = mbs.CreateForce(bodyNumber=oMass, loadVector=[10,0,0])

#Assemble has to be called just before solving or system analysis (after AddSensor!).
mbs.Assemble()

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Double pendulum consisting of two mass points which are connected with elastic springs with the following properties: mass m1 = 1 kg, mass m2 = 0.8 kg, length of the strings L1 = 1.5 m, L2 = 1.2 m, stiffnesses k1 = 3000 and k2 = 750, and gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The first arm of the pendulum points in positive x-direction and the second arm in negative x-direction.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The following Python example shows how to generate a multibody model in Exudyn, including most relevant features: 

#import Exudyn library and utilities
import exudyn as exu
from exudyn.utilities import *
import numpy as np

#set up new multibody system to work with
SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.
oGround = mbs.CreateGround(referencePosition=[0,0,0])

#Create a point mass object with specified mass at reference position with optional initial conditions
#physicsMass: the mass in kg
#referencePosition: initial/reference position at which mechanism is defined; 
#initialDisplacement: additional initial deviations from referencePosition; usually this is [0,0,0]
#initialVelocity: initial velocities of mass point
#all vectors always have 3 components, no matter if 2D or 3D problem
oMass = mbs.CreateMassPoint(physicsMass=5, referencePosition=[1,0,0], 
                            initialDisplacement=[0,0,0],  #optional, relative to reference position
                            initialVelocity=[0,0.5,0],    #optional
                            gravity=[0,-9.81,0])          #optional

#Create a linear spring-damper system between two bodies or between a body and the ground.
#NOTE: localPosition0 resp. localPosition1 are the positions relativ to body0 resp. 1 (or ground); localPosition is always [0,0,0] for point masses; on ground, localPosition depends on position where the spring-damper should be anchored
oSpringDamper = mbs.CreateSpringDamper(bodyNumbers=[oGround, oMass], #[body0,body1]
                                      localPosition0=[0,0,0], #locally on body0
                                      localPosition1=[0,0,0], #locally on body1
                                      referenceLength=None, #usually set to None (default) => takes the (relaxed) length in reference configuration
                                      stiffness=1e2, damping=1)

#Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
#apply 10N in x-direction on point mass with index oMass
loadMassPoint = mbs.CreateForce(bodyNumber=oMass, loadVector=[10,0,0])

#Assemble has to be called just before solving or system analysis (after AddSensor!).
mbs.Assemble()

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Multibody n-pendulum system consisting of 4 point masses connected with spring-dampers with the following properties: masses m = 3 kg, lengths of single elastic strings l_single = 0.3 m, stiffness k = 1000 and damping d = 400 of strings, and gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The pendulum starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned with the x-axis, the first mass located at x=0.3, with a spring-damper connected to ground.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Multibody n-pendulum system consisting of 4 point masses connected with spring-dampers with the following properties: masses m = 0.5 kg, lengths of single elastic strings l_single = 0.25 m, stiffness k = 10000 and damping d = 100 of strings, and gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The pendulum starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned with the x-axis, the first mass located at x=0.25, with a spring-damper connected to ground.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Straight elastic chain modelled with 10 mass points connected with spring-dampers with the following properties: masses m = 0.75 kg, lengths of each chain element l_single = 1.5 m, stiffness k = 5000 and damping d = 400 of chain elements, and gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The chain starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned with the x-axis, the first mass located at x=0. The left-most and right-most spring-dampers are fixed to ground using spherical joints.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

distance constraint: Create a rigid distance constraint between two points on different bodies or between a body and the ground.
rigid body omniform: Create a rigid body with an abitrary shape.
rigid body sphere: Create a rigid body with a spherical shape.
rigid body cylinder: Create a rigid body with a cylindrical shape.
rigid body brick-shape: Create a rigid body with a brick (cuboid) shape; uses rotated reference configuration.
force for point mass: Applies a force in a specific direction to a point mass.
force for rigid body: Applies a force in a specific direction to a rigid body at its local position.
force with time-dependent user function: Defines a time-dependent force function and applies it to a rigid body or mass point at a specific local position.

revolute joint: Create a revolute joint between two rigid bodies / ground, allowing rotation about a specified axis; not compatible with point mass.
torsional spring-damper: Create a torsional spring-damper between two bodies, ideally in combination with a revolute joint.
rolling disc with penalty-based joint: Create a rigid body of a cylindrical disc (or wheel), and a rolling disc joint between the disc and the ground (ground must be first body); ground is defined by planePosition and planeNormal and disc joint is defined in body-local coordinates with axisPosition and axisVector; uses penalty formulation with linear contact and damping model.
ideal rolling disc joint: Create a rigid body of a cylindrical disc (or wheel), and a joint between the rolling disc and the ground (ground must be first body); ground is defined by planePosition and planeNormal and disc joint is defined in body-local coordinates with axisPosition and axisVector
cartesian spring damper: Create a special spring-damper which acts on translations in global x, y, and z-direction, with possibility to connect rigid bodies, mass points together or on ground.

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
Straight elastic chain modelled with 17 mass points connected with spring-dampers with the following properties: masses m = 0.5 kg, lengths of each chain element l_single = 2.5 m, stiffness k = 3000 and damping d = 100 of chain elements, and gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The chain starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned with the x-axis, the first mass located at x=0. The left-most and right-most spring-dampers are fixed to ground using spherical joints.

Please list the elements that are required to build the given multibody model and which represent its mechanical behavior best, without repeating any element.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Straight elastic chain modelled with 8 mass points connected with spring-dampers with the following properties: masses m = 5 kg, lengths of each chain element l_single = 2 m, stiffness k = 2000 and damping d = 125 of chain elements, and gravity g = 11.15 m/s^2 which acts in negative y-direction. The chain starts from horizontal configuration, where all masses are aligned with the x-axis, the first mass located at x=0. The left-most and right-most spring-dampers are fixed to ground using spherical joints.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Pendulum modeled with a brick-shape rigid body and a revolute joint. The body has density = 8000 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=0.8m, wy=0.5m, hz=0.25m. The center of mass is equal to the reference point and initially located at [lx/2,0,0], while the revolute joint (rotation around z-axis) is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates). Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further force acts.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Pendulum modeled with a brick-shape rigid body and a revolute joint. The body has density = 1200 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=2m, wy=0.12m, hz=0.12m. The center of mass is equal to the reference point and initially located at [lx/2,0,0], while the revolute joint (rotation around z-axis) is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates). Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further force acts.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A 3D mass point with mass m = 1.2 kg is attached to a string with length 0.75 m, with a predominant rotation around the z-axis due to centrifugal forces.  Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative z-direction. The mass point is placed initially at [0.75,0,0] and the initial velocity is [0,8,0], given in m/s. The string shall be modelled as rigid distance between the mass point and the ground position at [0,0,0].

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
A 3D mass point with mass m = 5 kg is attached to a string with length 0.4 m, with a predominant rotation around the z-axis due to centrifugal forces. Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative z-direction. The mass point is placed initially at [0.4,0,0] and the initial velocity is [0,4,0], given in m/s. The elastic string shall be modelled as spring-damper with stiffness k = 4000 N/m and damping d = 30 Ns/m, which connects the mass point and the ground position at [0,0,0].

Please list the elements that are required to build the given multibody model and which represent its mechanical behavior best, without repeating any element.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A system consisting of two mass points connected by a distance constraint. The first mass m1 = 5 kg is initially located at x0 = 1.2 m (other coordinates are 0) and can freely move only along the x-axis, while y-axis and z-axis are constrained by a spherical joint. The second mass m2 = 6 kg is initially located at z0 = 1.2 m (other coordinates are 0) and can move only freely along the z-axis, while the other two axes are constrained by a spherical joint. Furthermore, a distance constraint is added between the two mass points and the length shall be computed automatically. A spring with stiffness = 300 N/m is used to connect mass m1 and ground at [0,0,0]. Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in positive y-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A system consisting of two mass points connected by a distance constraint. The first mass m1 = 12.5 kg is initially located at x0 = 1 m (other coordinates are 0) and can freely move only along the x-axis, while y-axis and z-axis are constrained by a spherical joint. The second mass m2 = 2.5 kg is initially located at z0 = 0.5 m (other coordinates are 0) and can move only freely along the z-axis, while the other two axes are constrained by a spherical joint. Furthermore, a distance constraint is added between the two mass points and the length shall be computed automatically. A spring with stiffness = 750 N/m is used to connect mass m1 and ground at [0,0,0]. Gravity g = 11.15 m/s^2 acts in positive x-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
A system consisting of two mass points connected by a distance constraint. The first mass m1 = 1.5 kg is initially located at x0 = 0.8 m (other coordinates are 0) and can freely move only along the x-axis, while y-axis and z-axis are constrained by a spherical joint. The second mass m2 = 2.5 kg is initially located at z0 = 0.75 m (other coordinates are 0) and can move only freely along the z-axis, while the other two axes are constrained by a spherical joint. Furthermore, a distance constraint is added between the two mass points and the length shall be computed automatically. A spring with stiffness = 600 N/m is used to connect mass m1 and ground at [0,0,0]. Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in positive x-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

SC = exu.SystemContainer()
mbs = SC.AddSystem()

#Create a ground object as an inertial reference frame for the multibody system.
#Create a ground object at given (optional) referencePosition.  Even several ground objects at specific positions can be added.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A rigid body is suspended by 4 Cartesian spring-dampers. The rigid body has a brick-shape with density = 500 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=3m, ly=1.2m, lz=1m. The reference point of the body, which is equal to the COM, is located initially at [0,1.2/2,0]. The Cartesian spring-dampers are located at the x/z positions of the vertices of the body. The y-local-position of the spring-dampers at the body is -1.2/2 and the local position for ground is y=0. All spring-dampers have equal parameters: stiffness = [20000,120000,12000] N/m and damping = [250,2000,400] Ns/m. Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied and contact with ground is ignored.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A gyro is modelled with a rigid body and a spherical joint. The gyro is modelled as cylindrical disc with mass m = 20 kg, disc radius r = 0.2 m, and disc width w = 0.04. The axis of the disc is initially oriented along positive x-axis and the disc is positioned at [0.2,0,0] (which is also the COM).

Gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 acts in negative z-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.

A gyro is modelled with a rigid body and a spherical joint. The gyro is modelled as cylindrical disc with mass m = 15 kg, disc radius r = 0.2 m, and disc width w = 0.04. The axis of the disc is initially oriented along positive x-axis and the disc is positioned at [0.25,0,0] (which is also the COM). The disc is connected to ground with a spherical joint at position [0,0,0]. The initial angular velocity of the disc is [200,0,0]. Gravity g = 11.15 m/s^2 acts in negative z-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The rigid body has a mass of m = 12.5 kg and the side lengths of the body are all equal with s = 0.25 m. A force f = 15 N acts on the rigid body's COM in y-direction. Gravity is neglected.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A rotor is modelled with a rigid body mounted on ground with Cartesian spring-dampers. The rotor is modelled as cylinder with mass m = 5 kg, disc radius r = 0.15 m, and length = 0.5 m. The axis of the rotor is initially oriented along the x-axis and the reference point of the rotor lies at [0,0,0] (which is also the COM). The rotor is connected to ground with two Cartesian spring-dampers at global position [-0.5/2,0,0] resp. [0.5/2,0,0], the positions being identical with the local positions of the spring-dampers on the rotor. The Cartesian spring-dampers have stiffness values [1250,2000,2000] N/m and damping values [7.5,10,10] Ns/m. The initial angular velocity of the rotor is [300,0,0]. Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A rotor is modelled with a rigid body mounted on ground with Cartesian spring-dampers. The rotor is modelled as cylinder with mass m = 2 kg, disc radius r = 0.1 m, and length = 0.8 m. The axis of the rotor is initially oriented along the x-axis and the reference point of the rotor lies at [0,0,0] (which is also the COM). The rotor is connected to ground with two Cartesian spring-dampers at global position [-0.8/2,0,0] resp. [0.8/2,0,0], the positions being identical with the local positions of the spring-dampers on the rotor. The Cartesian spring-dampers have stiffness values [1500,2000,2000] N/m and damping values [6,20,20] Ns/m. The initial angular velocity of the rotor is [300,0,0]. Gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further forces or damping are applied.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A rotor is modelled with a rigid body mounted on ground with Cartesian spring-dampers. The rotor is modelled as cylinder with mass m = 3 kg, disc radius r = 0.12 m, and length = 1 m. The axis of the rotor is initially oriented along the x-axis and the reference point of the rotor lies at [0,0,0]. The COM of the rigid body lies at [0,0.002,0], representing an unbalance U=3*0.002 kgm. The rotor is connected to ground with two Cartesian spring-dampers at global position [-1/2,0,0] resp. [1/2,0,0], the positions being identical with the local positions of the spring-dampers on the rotor. The Cartesian spring-dampers have stiffness values [1250,4000,4000] N/m and damping values [5,15,15] Ns/m. The rotor starts from zero velocity, and is driven by a torque [1,0,0] Nm. Gravity g = 3.73 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction. Simulate the rotor for 2s and use a stepSize of 0.2ms to meet the accuracy limits.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

A rotor is modelled with a rigid body mounted on ground with Cartesian spring-dampers. The rotor is modelled as cylinder with mass m = 3 kg, disc radius r = 0.1 m, and length = 0.75 m. The axis of the rotor is initially oriented along the x-axis and the reference point of the rotor lies at [0,0,0].

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A rotor is modelled with a rigid body mounted on ground with Cartesian spring-dampers. The rotor is modelled as cylinder with mass m = 3 kg, disc radius r = 0.1 m, and length = 0.75 m. The axis of the rotor is initially oriented along the x-axis and the reference point of the rotor lies at [0,0,0]. The COM of the rigid body lies at [0,0.00125,0], representing an unbalance U=3*0.00125 kgm. The rotor is connected to ground with two Cartesian spring-dampers at global position [-0.75/2,0,0] resp. [0.75/2,0,0], the positions being identical with the local positions of the spring-dampers on the rotor. The Cartesian spring-dampers have stiffness values [1200,3000,3000] N/m and damping values [8,10,10] Ns/m. The rotor starts from zero velocity, and is driven by a torque [1,0,0] Nm. Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative z-direction. Simulate the rotor for 2s and use a stepSize of 0.2ms to meet the accuracy limits.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
Double pendulum modeled with brick-shape rigid bodies and revolute joints. Both bodies have density = 4000 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=0.75 m, wy=0.25 m, hz=0.3 m. The first body's center is located initially at [lx/2,0,0] and the second body at [3*lx/2,0,0], both bodies having their COM locally at [0,0,0] (not translated). The first revolute joint between ground and body 1 is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates), and the second revolute joint between body 1 and body 2 is located at [lx,0,0] (global coordinates). Both revolute joints' have a free rotation around the z-axis.Gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further force acts.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

The first revolute joint between ground and body 1 is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates), and the second revolute joint between body 1 and body 2 is located at [lx,0,0] (global coordinates). Both revolute joints' have a free rotation around the z-axis.Gravity g = 11.15 m/s^2 acts in negative y-direction, and no further force acts.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
A slider-crank mechanism is given with a crank rotating about the z-axis. The crank is modelled as rigid body with cylinder shape (axis=z) with mass m = 2 kg, radius r = 0.25 m, and width = 0.08 m, and it is initially located at [0,0,-0.08]. The brick-shaped conrod and piston have identical parameters: density = 7850 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=0.5 m, wy=0.075 m, hz=0.1 m, initially not rotated (straight configuration of slider-crank). The conrod's center is located initially at [r+0.5*lx,0,0] and the piston is initially located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0]. A torque [0,0,T] shall act on the crank, employing a user-function with T=1.5 Nm until 1 s and 0 thereafter. The revolute joint between ground and crank is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates), the revolute joint between crank and conrod is located at [r,0,0] (global coordinates), and the revolute joint between conrod and piston is located at [r+lx,0,0] (global coordinates). The prismatic joint (axis=x) between ground and piston is located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0] (global coordinates). No gravity acts on the system. Simulate the system for 2 s.

Please list the elements that are required to build the given multibody model and which represent its mechanical behavior best, without repeating any element.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A slider-crank mechanism is given with a crank rotating about the z-axis. The crank is modelled as rigid body with cylinder shape (axis=z) with mass m = 2 kg, radius r = 0.25 m, and width = 0.08 m, and it is initially located at [0,0,-0.08]. The brick-shaped conrod and piston have identical parameters: density = 7850 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=0.5 m, wy=0.075 m, hz=0.1 m, initially not rotated (straight configuration of slider-crank). The conrod's center is located initially at [r+0.5*lx,0,0] and the piston is initially located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0]. A torque [0,0,T] shall act on the crank, employing a user-function with T=1.5 Nm until 1 s and 0 thereafter. The revolute joint between ground and crank is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates), the revolute joint between crank and conrod is located at [r,0,0] (global coordinates), and the revolute joint between conrod and piston is located at [r+lx,0,0] (global coordinates). The prismatic joint (axis=x) between ground and piston is located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0] (global coordinates). No gravity acts on the system. Simulate the system for 2 s.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".

Given is a multibody model with the following description:
A slider-crank mechanism is given with a crank rotating about the z-axis. The crank is modelled as rigid body with cylinder shape (axis=z) with mass m = 2.5 kg, radius r = 0.2 m, and width = 0.075 m, and it is initially located at [0,0,-0.075]. The brick-shaped conrod and piston have identical parameters: density = 7850 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=0.5 m, wy=0.075 m, hz=0.075 m, initially not rotated (straight configuration of slider-crank). The conrod's center is located initially at [r+0.5*lx,0,0] and the piston is initially located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0]. A torque [0,0,T] shall act on the crank, employing a user-function with T=2 Nm until 1 s and 0 thereafter. The revolute joint between ground and crank is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates), the revolute joint between crank and conrod is located at [r,0,0] (global coordinates), and the revolute joint between conrod and piston is located at [r+lx,0,0] (global coordinates). The prismatic joint (axis=x) between ground and piston is located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0] (global coordinates). No gravity acts on the system. Simulate the system for 2 s.

Using this example, please build a Python model following exactly the following description of a multibody model:
A slider-crank mechanism is given with a crank rotating about the z-axis. The crank is modelled as rigid body with cylinder shape (axis=z) with mass m = 2.5 kg, radius r = 0.2 m, and width = 0.075 m, and it is initially located at [0,0,-0.075]. The brick-shaped conrod and piston have identical parameters: density = 7850 kg/m^3, and xyz-dimensions lx=0.5 m, wy=0.075 m, hz=0.075 m, initially not rotated (straight configuration of slider-crank). The conrod's center is located initially at [r+0.5*lx,0,0] and the piston is initially located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0]. A torque [0,0,T] shall act on the crank, employing a user-function with T=2 Nm until 1 s and 0 thereafter. The revolute joint between ground and crank is located at [0,0,0] (global coordinates), the revolute joint between crank and conrod is located at [r,0,0] (global coordinates), and the revolute joint between conrod and piston is located at [r+lx,0,0] (global coordinates). The prismatic joint (axis=x) between ground and piston is located at [r+1.5*lx,0,0] (global coordinates). No gravity acts on the system. Simulate the system for 2 s.

Follow exactly the function names and argument names as given in the example and create the Exudyn model.
Provide only the Python code without any additional descriptions; you don't need to add comments, except for special cases.
It is very important that you start the code with required imports and that you mark the end of code with the line "#end-of-code".
